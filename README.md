### Atlassian

The plugin supports two authentication paths:

**Option 1 — Atlassian CLI (recommended):**
```bash
brew install atlassian/tap/acli
acli auth login
```

**Option 2 — API token (for curl fallback):**

Generate a token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens, then set:

```bash
export ATLASSIAN_DOMAIN="your-domain"    # e.g. mycompany (for mycompany.atlassian.net)
export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL="you@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

### Google Workspace

Install and authenticate the `gws` CLI:

```bash
npm i -g @anthropic-ai/gws
gws auth login -s gmail,calendar
```

For full setup instructions, see: https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli

### Research Plugin

No authentication required. The research plugin uses WebSearch and WebFetch which work out of the box.
