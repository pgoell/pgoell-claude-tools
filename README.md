```bash
brew install atlassian/tap/acli
acli auth login

**Option 2 — API token (for curl fallback):**

Generate a token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens, then set:

```bash
export ATLASSIAN_DOMAIN="your-domain"    # e.g. mycompany (for mycompany.atlassian.net)
export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL="you@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

gws auth login -s gmail,calendar
```

### Research Plugin

No authentication required. The research plugin uses WebSearch and WebFetch which work out of the box.
