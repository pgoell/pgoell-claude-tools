# pgoell-claude-tools

A personal plugin marketplace for Claude Code and Codex.

The two runtimes use separate plugin metadata, but the skills are single sourced. Claude Code reads `.claude-plugin` metadata. Codex reads `.codex-plugin` metadata and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. Both point at the same `plugins/<plugin>/skills/` directories.

## Plugins

### atlassian

Jira and Confluence skills for the Atlassian suite — search, create, update, and manage work items and pages.

**Skills:**
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:jira` — Search issues, create/update tickets, transition status, add comments, manage sprints
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:confluence` — Search pages, read documentation, create/update pages, browse spaces

### google-workspace

Gmail and Calendar skills for Google Workspace — powered by the `gws` CLI.

**Skills:**
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:gmail` — Search, read, send, and manage Gmail messages, drafts, labels, and filters
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:calendar` — View agenda, create and manage events, check availability, manage calendars

### research

Orchestrator-driven deep research with parallel cluster researchers, synthesis under independent review, and a writer pass that produces a polished report.

**Skills:**
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:research`: orchestrator-driven pipeline. Plans the work internally, spawns parallel deep-research subagents (one per topic cluster, iterative until saturation, single-md output with inline sources), synthesizes findings, and writes the final report. Two independent review gates (synthesis-reviewer for substance, writer-reviewer for prose) with unbounded review loops, periodic check-ins, and stall detection.

### writing

Multi-phase writing pipeline modelled on Katie Parrott's process. Interview, outline, throughline gate (≤10-word compression), draft, panel review (seven critics including steel-man preemption audit), and finishing passes for blog posts and longer-form prose. Format-aware: opt-in Smart-Brevity critic for memos, newsletters, and announcements. Also ships a dedicated Pyramid Principle skill for memos, recommendations, and analytical documents, and a Diátaxis-aware tech-doc skill for tutorials, how-to guides, references, and explanations.

**Skills:**
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:writing`: orchestrates the full pipeline with phase-selectable resume. For analytical formats (memo, briefing, announcement), dispatches to the pyramid skill for the outline phase and runs an analytical draft prompt. Ships with a default style guide that any project can override.
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:pyramid`: produces a pyramid-structured outline (greenfield) or restructures an existing draft into pyramid form. Five phases (intake, construct, audit, opener, render) with a parallel audit panel (MECE, So-What, Q-A Alignment, Inductive-Deductive).
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:tech-doc`: Diátaxis-aware technical writing pipeline. Drafts and reviews tutorials, how-to guides, API and CLI references, and conceptual explanations. Bundles full transcriptions of the Microsoft Writing Style Guide and Google Developer Documentation Style Guide as selectable presets (with a merged `house` default), each preset structured as eight topic-scoped sidecars. Six-phase pipeline (intake, outline, throughline, draft, panel, finishing) with eight-critic panel per quadrant and three sequential finishing passes (AI-pattern-detector, style-enforcer-tech, terminology-consistency).

### runtime-bridge

Aligns Claude Code and Codex artifacts across a project. When Claude Code and Codex work together on the same codebase, this skill helps ensure files are formatted and structured consistently so both runtimes can understand them.

**Skills:**
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:claude-codex-bridge`: Analyze and align Claude Code and Codex artifacts

### agents-md-management

Audit and maintain `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files (and variants like `AGENTS.local.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude.md`, `.claude.local.md`, plus user-global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`). Symlink-aware via `realpath`, so `CLAUDE.md` symlinked to `AGENTS.md` counts as one logical file. Derived from Anthropic's `claude-md-management` plugin by Isabella He, with adaptations for cross-runtime use.

**Skills:**
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:agents-md-improver`: Periodic cold audit. Scores each file against a six-criterion rubric, outputs a quality report, then proposes targeted edits with confirmation.
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:agents-md-session-capture`: End-of-session warm capture. Reflects on what context was missing, classifies each learning by scope (project-shared, project-local, user-global), and routes additions to the right file. Triggers on `/revise-agents-md` or `/revise-claude-md`.

### workbench

Personal fork-as-you-touch skill collection. Today: brainstorming (a design dialogue that turns ideas into specs, with a browser-based visual companion) and a trimmed meta-skill that layers on top of upstream `superpowers:using-superpowers`. More skills will be added as Pascal commits to owning them.

**Skills:**
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:brainstorming`: Design dialogue from idea to spec, with a visual-companion mode
- `/pgoell-claude-tools:using-workbench`: Meta-skill announcing Workbench skills, defers core meta-rules to upstream

## Installation

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add pgoell/pgoell-claude-tools
/plugin install atlassian@pgoell-claude-tools
/plugin install google-workspace@pgoell-claude-tools
/plugin install research@pgoell-claude-tools
/plugin install writing@pgoell-claude-tools
/plugin install runtime-bridge@pgoell-claude-tools
/plugin install agents-md-management@pgoell-claude-tools
/plugin install workbench@pgoell-claude-tools
```

### Codex

Add the marketplace from your shell:

```
codex plugin marketplace add pgoell/pgoell-claude-tools
```

Then install plugins from inside Codex:

```
codex
/plugins
```

In the picker, install `atlassian`, `google-workspace`, `research`, `writing`, `runtime-bridge`, `agents-md-management`, and `workbench`.

`codex plugin marketplace add` accepts `owner/repo[@ref]`, an HTTPS or SSH Git URL, or a local marketplace root directory. The marketplace file lives at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and the per-plugin Codex manifests live at `plugins/<plugin>/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Both reuse the same `plugins/<plugin>/skills/` directories as Claude Code, single sourced.

To pick up changes, run `codex plugin marketplace upgrade pgoell-claude-tools` and re-install the affected plugins from `/plugins` inside Codex. Codex does not poll for updates; it uses the cached snapshot from `add` time until you upgrade.

## Setup

### Atlassian

The plugin supports two authentication paths:

**Option 1 — Atlassian CLI (recommended):**
```bash
brew install atlassian/tap/acli
acli auth login
```

**Option 2 — API token (for curl fallback):**

Generate a token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens, then set:

```bash
export ATLASSIAN_DOMAIN="your-domain"    # e.g. mycompany (for mycompany.atlassian.net)
export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL="you@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

### Google Workspace

Install and authenticate the `gws` CLI:

```bash
npm i -g @anthropic-ai/gws
gws auth login -s gmail,calendar
```

For full setup instructions, see: https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli

### Research Plugin

No authentication required. The research plugin uses the host agent's web search and fetch or browse tools.

### runtime-bridge

No setup required. In any project, ask the skill to align Claude Code and Codex artifacts (e.g. "make this project work with both Claude Code and Codex"). After the first apply that writes into `.codex/`, run `codex` once in that project and accept the trust prompt.

### agents-md-management

No setup required. In any project, ask either skill: "audit my CLAUDE.md files" (cold audit) or "update AGENTS.md with what we learned this session" (warm capture). Operates on local agent-instruction files only; no network or auth.
