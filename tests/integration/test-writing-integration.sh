# Why I stopped using semaphores

*Draft v1*

I used to leverage semaphores for concurrency control in all of my services. It's worth noting that they are an incredibly powerful primitive, providing robust synchronization across threads. However, I've come to realize that they are also a source of significant complexity in modern codebases.

The fact that semaphores require explicit acquire and release calls means that any programmer can forget one. There is the additional problem that deadlocks become possible when multiple semaphores are involved. In my experience, the cost is rarely worth it.

I now navigate the complexities of concurrency by using channels instead. Here's the thing about channels: they enforce ownership semantics in a way semaphores do not. At the end of the day, this leads to more maintainable code.

In conclusion, semaphores are a tool of last resort.
