Turn 6 (sibling 2): 'Market timing favors Q1 launch over later quarters.' Turn 7 (sibling 3): 'Comparable rounds in Q1 closed faster than Q3 last year.' Turn 8 (add or stop): stop at three. Turn 9 (evidence for sibling 1): 'Burn rate is 1.2M/month; current cash buys us through July; closing a round takes 3-4 months.' Turn 10 (evidence for sibling 2): 'Two key competitors announce in Q2; press cycle is favorable through April; product launch is dated for Feb.'
