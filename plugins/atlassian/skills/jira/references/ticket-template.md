# Ticket writing template

Read this when the user opts into the default template for a story, task, or research or design ticket.

Maps a good ticket into the standard **Description + Acceptance Criteria** fields. Use this before assigning research/design tickets especially. That's where most underspecification bites.

---

## Description (field 1)

```markdown
## Context

[1-3 sentences: why this matters now, what triggered it]

## Deliverable

[The actual artifact. Be concrete:

- Confluence page at <location>
- Merged PR in <repo>
- ADR in /docs/decisions
- 15-min demo in <forum>
- Decision memo tagging <people>
  Not "investigate X". What do I get at the end?]

## Scope

- In: [what's explicitly included]
- Out: [what's explicitly excluded; prevents scope creep]

## Stakeholders

- Review: [names: who signs off]
- Input needed from: [names: who to talk to]
- FYI: [names]

## Timebox

[Xh soft / Yh hard. If hard cap hits and you're not done,
bring it back to refinement; don't silently extend.]

## References

- [Related doc]
- [Related ticket XYZ-123]
```

## Acceptance Criteria (field 2)

```markdown
## Done when

- [ ] [Checkable condition 1]
- [ ] [Checkable condition 2]
- [ ] [Checkable condition 3]

## Key decisions to make (research/design only)

- [ ] Question 1: [e.g., should we use X or Y for Z?]
- [ ] Question 2: [e.g., who owns cleanup?]
```

**Rule:** If you can't write 2-3 checkboxes for "Done when", the ticket isn't ready; it's still a topic. Send it back to refinement, don't assign it.

## When to use which sections

| Ticket type                   | Must have                                    | Can skip                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Bug fix                       | Context, Deliverable (PR), Done when, Scope  | Decisions, Stakeholders |
| Feature implementation        | All except Decisions                         | Decisions (usually)     |
| Research / investigation      | **All**, especially Deliverable + Done when  | none                    |
| Design / architecture         | **All**, especially Decisions + Stakeholders | none                    |
| Spike / timeboxed exploration | Context, Deliverable, Timebox, Done when     | Scope (loose by design) |

## The three questions that catch 80% of bad tickets

Before you hit save, ask:

1. **"What artifact do I get?"**: If the answer is a verb ("investigate", "analyze"), you don't have a deliverable. Pick a format.
2. **"How do I know it's done?"**: If you can't list 2-3 checkboxes, the scope isn't defined yet.
3. **"Who does the assignee need to talk to?"**: If unnamed, they'll either skip those conversations or block waiting for you to name them.

If any of these fail, the ticket isn't refined; it's a topic.

## Example: before/after

**Before:**

> Investigate and evaluate how Claude Code skills can be set up and integrated with the Gini Code environment. Analyze the risks of end users executing Gini-generated code.

Problems: Two tickets in one. No deliverable. No done-state. No scope bound.

**After (description):**

> **Context:** We want to codify platform-specific context (data rigs, dbt, data product configs) into reusable Claude Code skills so the team doesn't re-solve the same patterns.
>
> **Deliverable:** Confluence page `Platform / Claude Code Skills Playbook` covering (a) how to author skills for our environment, (b) how to deploy them, (c) 2 worked examples.
>
> **Scope (in):** skill authoring, deployment, 2 examples (data rigs + dbt).
> **Scope (out):** security risk analysis (split to separate ticket), IDE integrations.
>
> **Stakeholders:** Review: [me]. Input from: [platform lead]. FYI: team.
>
> **Timebox:** 8h soft / 16h hard.

**After (acceptance criteria):**

> - [ ] Playbook page published in Confluence under Platform space
> - [ ] 2 working skill examples checked in and linked from page
> - [ ] At least one teammate has reviewed and confirmed they could author a skill from the doc
> - [ ] Decision documented: where do team skills live (shared repo vs. per-project)?
