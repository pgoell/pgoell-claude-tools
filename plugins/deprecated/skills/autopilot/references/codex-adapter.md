# Codex Adapter for Workbench Autopilot

This doc maps the autopilot skill's tool references to Codex equivalents. The autopilot `SKILL.md` uses Claude Code tool names by default; this adapter is consulted when the runtime is Codex.

## Tool name mapping

| `SKILL.md` reference            | Codex equivalent                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Skill`                         | `skill`                                                                                                          |
| `Agent` (subagent)              | Codex's task or subagent equivalent if installed; otherwise sequential execution in the main session (see below) |
| `Monitor`                       | `run_in_background` plus a polling loop, or Codex's monitoring primitive if present                              |
| `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` | Equivalent Codex tools (see `../using-workbench/references/codex-tools.md` for the broader table)                |
| `gh`                            | Same; invoked via the shell tool                                                                                 |

## Subagent strategy on Codex

`workbench:subagent-driven-development` is best-effort on Codex. The autopilot expects a fresh subagent per plan task. If Codex's runtime exposes such a primitive, use it. If it does not, fall back to **sequential execution in the main session with explicit context-reset discipline**:

1. Treat each plan task as its own logical scope.
2. Before starting a task, write a one-line context-reset note: `--- starting task <n>: <title> ---`. This is for legibility, not behavior.
3. Execute the task end-to-end (write code, run tests, commit) before moving to the next.
4. After completing a task, write a one-line note: `--- completed task <n> ---`.
5. Continue with the next task.

Sequential fallback gives up the fanout from `deprecated:dispatching-parallel-agents` but preserves the per-task discipline of subagent-driven-development.

## CI polling shape (step 8)

Use `run_in_background` to launch the polling loop, or Codex's monitoring primitive if it has one. The query is the same:

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json statusCheckRollup -q '.statusCheckRollup[] | "\(.status):\(.conclusion // "")"'
```

Loop with a sleep interval that respects Codex's runtime budget; aim for 30-60 seconds between polls during normal CI runs.

## Subagent error recovery

If Codex's subagent primitive errors, recover the same way as Claude Code: from the main session, inspect partial work via `git status` / `git diff`, continue in the main session if the partial work survived, note "Continuing from subagent state" in the next commit body.

## Common Codex caveats

- **No `Monitor` equivalent in some runtimes.** Use the polling fallback; do not skip step 8.
- **Tool names are case-sensitive.** `skill` is lowercase on Codex; `Skill` is uppercase on Claude Code.
- **Same `gh` and `git` semantics.** GitHub CLI behavior is identical; Conventional Commits enforcement still applies.

## What this adapter does NOT cover

- A live Codex CI test of autopilot's flow. Adapter docs ship in PR 2; runtime-parity validation is future work (see the spec's "Future work" section).
- Auto-detection of which runtime is active inside `SKILL.md`. The agent reads the appropriate adapter doc based on the runtime they know they are running in.
