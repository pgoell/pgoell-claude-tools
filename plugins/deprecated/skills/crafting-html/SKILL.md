description: Deprecated and retired without replacement. Formerly used when producing a standalone HTML artifact that no other workbench skill (writing-spec, writing-plans, brainstorming, systematic-debugging) or research:research covers, such as a PR walkthrough, code explainer, slide deck, status or incident report, design prototype, SVG illustration, or custom editing tool.

# Crafting HTML Artifacts

> **Deprecated.** Retired without replacement. This copy is archived and no longer maintained.

HTML is the right medium for share-once expository content. It carries information density that markdown cannot match (tables with design, SVG diagrams, color-coded annotations, syntax-highlighted code blocks, expandable sections, mobile-responsive layout), it shares as a link without rendering tools, and it supports two-way interaction (sliders, copy-as-prompt buttons, drag-and-drop editors). Markdown's editability advantage does not apply to artifacts the reader does not edit.

This skill differs from `frontend-design`. `frontend-design` builds UI and components, where the artifact is part of a product. This skill produces single-file expository HTML documents, where the artifact is a communication.

## When NOT to use this skill

- Specs: use `deprecated:writing-spec`.
- Plans: use `deprecated:writing-plans`.
- Brainstorm summaries: use `deprecated:brainstorming`.
- Debug reports: use `deprecated:systematic-debugging`.
- Research reports: use `research:research`.
- Multi-slide presentations with a deck-stage engine and presenter mode: use `presentations:creating-presentations`. The `references/09-slide-deck.html` template here is the quick single-file fallback for one-off decks.
- UI or component code: use `frontend-design`.

## Five categories of HTML artifacts

| Category                      | Reference files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Specs, planning, exploration  | `references/01-exploration-code-approaches.html`, `references/02-exploration-visual-designs.html`, `references/16-implementation-plan.html`                                                                                                                                                 |
| Code review and understanding | `references/03-code-review-pr.html`, `references/04-code-understanding.html`, `references/17-pr-writeup.html`                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Design and prototypes         | `references/05-design-system.html`, `references/06-component-variants.html`, `references/07-prototype-animation.html`, `references/08-prototype-interaction.html`                                                                                                                           |
| Reports, research, learning   | `references/09-slide-deck.html`, `references/10-svg-illustrations.html`, `references/11-status-report.html`, `references/12-incident-report.html`, `references/13-flowchart-diagram.html`, `references/14-research-feature-explainer.html`, `references/15-research-concept-explainer.html` |
| Custom editing interfaces     | `references/18-editor-triage-board.html`, `references/19-editor-feature-flags.html`, `references/20-editor-prompt-tuner.html`                                                                                                                                                               |

`references/index.html` is the upstream's gallery index page, kept as the 21st file for reference; it is not assigned to a category.

## Universal patterns

- Single-file HTML5; no external dependencies.
- Inline `<style>` block; no separate CSS files or CDN imports.
- Mobile-responsive viewport meta tag; layout works at narrow widths.
- Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`).
- Inline `<svg>` for diagrams.
- For two-way interaction, include copy-link or copy-as-prompt buttons.
- No U+2014 or U+2013 codepoints in body copy. HTML entity forms (`&mdash;`, `&#8212;`, `&ndash;`, `&#8211;`) are permitted.
- Realistic placeholder content; do not leave `Lorem ipsum` or empty sections.

## How to use the references

Read one reference file matching the artifact type before generating. Do not load all 21 files (20 reference examples plus `references/index.html`); each example is self-contained and roughly 10 to 25 KB. The category map above is the index. The host agent reads `references/<file>.html` on demand, not proactively.

## Output Format

### Applying a design system

Before emitting HTML, check whether a design system is set: a per-prompt override (e.g., "render with the `brand-2026` design system"), else `.workbench/config.md` `## Design system` `Name:`. If one is set, read `../crafting-design-systems/references/applying-a-design-system.md` and follow it. If none is set, emit with the template's defaults.

`crafting-html` references vary in their CSS variable surface; inspect the chosen reference template's `:root` to know which design-system variables apply.

To create or edit a design system, see `deprecated:crafting-design-systems`.
