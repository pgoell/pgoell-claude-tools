## Clarity & hedge-words

| Term                          | Replacement             | Mechanical | Notes                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 24/7                          | all day, every day      | no         | Avoid the numeral shorthand; write out the meaning in plain language.             |
| additionally                  | also                    | no         | Prefer the shorter word when both convey the same meaning.                        |
| and/or                        | and / or                | no         | Pick one connector; use both only when the distinction genuinely matters.         |
| as a means to                 | to                      | yes        | Wordy infinitive phrase; trim to "to" whenever possible.                          |
| as well as                    | and                     | no         | Often interchangeable with "and"; prefer "and" for simplicity.                    |
| at this point in time         | now                     | yes        | Verbose time phrase; replace with "now" or rewrite the sentence.                  |
| currently                     | (drop)                  | no         | Avoid in evergreen documentation because it implies the content may become stale. |
| due to the fact that          | because                 | yes        | Wordy causal phrase; "because" is shorter and equally precise.                    |
| e.g.                          | for example             | yes        | Avoid the Latin abbreviation; write out "for example" in full.                    |
| easy, easily                  | (drop)                  | no         | Subjective qualifier; what is easy for an expert may not be for a beginner.       |
| establish connectivity        | connect                 | yes        | Verbose phrase; use the plain verb "connect".                                     |
| etc.                          | (drop)                  | no         | Avoid; list specific items or use "such as" to introduce representative examples. |
| eventually                    | (drop)                  | no         | Vague time reference; use a specific timeframe when possible.                     |
| for free                      | free                    | yes        | "Free" alone is sufficient; "for free" is redundant.                              |
| i.e.                          | that is                 | yes        | Avoid the Latin abbreviation; write out "that is" instead.                        |
| in addition                   | also                    | yes        | Wordy connector; "also" is shorter and equally clear.                             |
| in order to                   | to                      | yes        | Wordy infinitive phrase; trim to "to" in almost all cases.                        |
| inform, let know              | tell                    | no         | Prefer the simpler verb "tell" when the meaning is the same.                      |
| just                          | (drop)                  | no         | Filler word that rarely adds meaning; remove in most contexts.                    |
| leverage (verb)               | use / take advantage of | no         | Avoid using "leverage" to mean "use"; it is marketing jargon.                     |
| make use of                   | use                     | yes        | Verbose phrase; "use" is always clearer.                                          |
| note that                     | (drop)                  | no         | Introduces filler before the actual content; rewrite the sentence directly.       |
| please                        | (drop)                  | no         | Unnecessary in instructions; can sound condescending or overly formal.            |
| quite                         | (drop)                  | no         | Vague intensifier; remove or replace with a specific qualifier.                   |
| really                        | (drop)                  | no         | Filler intensifier; removing it rarely changes meaning.                           |
| simple, simply                | (drop)                  | no         | Avoid; what seems simple to the author may not be to the reader.                  |
| since (causal)                | because                 | no         | When "since" means "because," use "because" to remove temporal ambiguity.         |
| take away, extract, eliminate | remove                  | no         | Prefer the plain verb "remove" when that is the intended meaning.                 |
| there is / there are          | (drop)                  | no         | Weak sentence openers; rewrite to lead with the actual subject.                   |
| utilize                       | use                     | yes        | Almost always replaceable with "use"; "utilize" sounds unnecessarily formal.      |
| very                          | (drop)                  | no         | Intensifier without specificity; remove or replace with a precise qualifier.      |
| via                           | through / by using      | no         | Acceptable in technical contexts, but "through" or "by using" is usually clearer. |

| clear (checkbox)          | (keep, see Notes)                | no         | Correct term for removing a checkbox selection; do not use "deselect" or "uncheck".                   |
| click                     | select                           | no         | Microsoft now prefers the input-neutral verb "select" rather than mouse-specific "click".             |

| right-click               | select and hold (or right-click) | no         | For touch-inclusive docs, pair with "select and hold"; right-click alone is fine for mouse-only docs. |
