description: Capture learnings from the current session and update AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md (and variants, including user-global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and ~/.codex/AGENTS.md) with context that would help future sessions. Use when the user wants to "update CLAUDE.md with what we learned", "capture session learnings", "revise AGENTS.md", or types "/revise-agents-md" or "/revise-claude-md". Routes each learning to the right file by scope: project-specific learnings to AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, personal overrides to *.local.md, generalizable rules to the user-global file.
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Edit

# Agents.md Session Capture

Review the current session for context that was missing and would have helped the host agent. Propose targeted additions to the right agent-instruction file by scope.

## Platform Adaptation

| Capability | Claude Code | Codex |
|---|---|---|
| Find files | `Glob` / `Grep` | `shell` (`find`, `grep`) |
| Read a file | `Read` | `shell` (`cat`) |
| Edit a file | `Edit` | `apply_patch` / `shell` heredoc |
| User confirmation | `AskUserQuestion` | `ask_user` / built-in approval prompt |
| Shell commands | `Bash` | `shell` |

The skill body refers to actions abstractly. The host agent maps to its own tool inventory.

## Step 1: Reflect

What context was missing during this session that would have helped the host agent?

- Bash commands that were used or discovered
- Code style patterns followed
- Testing approaches that worked
- Environment / configuration quirks
- Warnings or gotchas encountered
- Tool preferences (e.g. "always use ripgrep over grep here")

## Step 2: Discover candidate files

Find every agent-instruction file in scope (project + user-global), dedupe symlinked pairs via `realpath`:

```bash
{
  find . \( \
      -name "AGENTS.md" \
      -o -name "AGENTS.local.md" \
      -o -name "CLAUDE.md" \
      -o -name "CLAUDE.local.md" \
      -o -name ".claude.md" \
      -o -name ".claude.local.md" \
    \) -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' 2>/dev/null
  ls ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null
} | xargs -I{} realpath {} | sort -u
```

When two paths share the same `realpath`, treat them as one logical file. Edits target the canonical realpath.

## Step 3: Classify each learning by scope

Decide where each addition belongs before drafting it:

| Scope | Target file | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Project-shared | `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (canonical) | Build commands, this codebase's quirks, team-wide conventions |
| Project-local | `AGENTS.local.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md` | Your personal overrides for this project, not for the team |
| User-global | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` / `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | Cross-project rules: writing style, tool preferences, system-wide preferences |

If a learning is generic enough to apply to other projects, route it to the user-global file rather than this project's AGENTS.md. Avoid duplication: if a rule already exists in the user-global file, don't restate it project-locally.

## Step 4: Draft additions

**Keep it concise**, one line per concept. Agent-instruction files are part of the prompt, so brevity matters.

Format: `<command or pattern>`, `<brief description>`

Avoid:
- Verbose explanations
- Obvious information
- One-off fixes unlikely to recur

## Step 5: Show proposed changes

For each addition:

````markdown
### Update: ./AGENTS.md

**Why:** [one-line reason]

```diff
+ [the addition; keep it brief]
```
````

Group by target file. Show all proposed edits to one file together.

## Step 6: Apply with approval

Ask if the user wants to apply the changes. Only edit files they approve. Use the right edit tool per Platform Adaptation. Edit the canonical realpath target only; symlinks update automatically.
