# frontend-design

Generate distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

The skill guides Claude (and Codex) to:

- Commit to a clear, bold aesthetic direction (brutalist, editorial, retro-futuristic, refined minimalism, etc.)
- Use distinctive typography and cohesive color palettes
- Apply high-impact motion, unexpected layouts, and atmospheric backgrounds
- Avoid the generic AI defaults (Inter on white, purple gradients, cookie-cutter components)

Triggered automatically when the user asks to build a web component, page, or application.

## Usage

```
"Create a dashboard for a music streaming app"
"Build a landing page for an AI security startup"
"Design a settings panel with dark mode"
"Build a portfolio site with a brutalist aesthetic"
```

Claude picks a clear aesthetic direction and writes production code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) with meticulous attention to detail.
