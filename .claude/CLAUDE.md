## Current Plugins

| Plugin | Version | Skills |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `atlassian` | 1.2.0 | `jira`, `confluence` |
| `google-workspace` | 1.0.0 | `gmail`, `calendar` |

## How to Develop a New Skill

### 1. Plan the skill

- Identify the CLI tool or API the skill wraps
- Decide if wrapper scripts are needed (skip if the CLI already handles auth, JSON output, and error codes well — see `google-workspace` as an example)
- Define operation tiers: Tier 1 (Read), Tier 2 (Write), Tier 3 (Manage/Admin)

### 2. Create the plugin structure

If adding to an existing plugin, just add a new `skills/<service>/` directory. For a new plugin:

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/<plugin-name>/.claude-plugin
mkdir -p plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<service>
```

Create `plugin.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "<plugin-name>",
  "description": "<one-line description>",
  "author": { "name": "Pascal Kraus" },
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["<relevant>", "<keywords>"]
}
```

Register in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` by adding to the `plugins` array.

### 3. Write SKILL.md

This is the most important file — it's what Claude reads to understand the skill. Follow this structure:

```markdown
---
name: <service>
description: Use when the user wants to <what this skill does>
---

# <Service> Skill

<One-line description>

---

## Auth Gate
<How to verify credentials before any operation>

## Tool Preference
<What tools to use and in what priority order>

## Operations — Tier 1 (Read)
<Read-only operations with exact commands>

## Operations — Tier 2 (Write)
<Create/update operations with exact commands>

## Operations — Tier 3 (Manage)
<Admin/destructive operations with exact commands>

## Self-Healing
<What to do when commands fail — help flags, schema inspection, error codes>

## Behavioral Guidelines
<How Claude should infer intent and pick operations>
```

Key principles:
- **Exact commands** — show copy-pasteable commands, not pseudocode
- **Auth gate is a hard stop** — no operations proceed without auth
- **Prefer helpers over raw API** — if the CLI has convenience commands, use them
- **Confirm before destructive ops** — always ask the user before delete operations
- **Self-healing is critical** — tell Claude how to debug when things go wrong

### 4. Add reference docs

Create `<service>-<topic>.md` files for complex query syntaxes, format references, or recipe collections. Keep them in the same directory as SKILL.md. Reference them from SKILL.md with `See <filename>`.

Examples:
- `jql-recipes.md` — JQL query patterns for Jira
- `gmail-search-recipes.md` — Gmail search operators
- `calendar-recipes.md` — Calendar operation patterns

### 5. Write tests

Follow the existing patterns in `tests/`:

**Unit tests** (`tests/unit/test-<service>-skill.sh`):
- Verify skill loads and is recognized
- Check it describes its capabilities
- Verify it mentions the correct tool
- Check supporting references are mentioned
- Pattern: `run_claude "<prompt>" | assert_contains "<pattern>"`

**Integration tests** (`tests/integration/test-<service>-integration.sh`):
- Require live auth (skip gracefully if not available)
- Test the full CRUD lifecycle: create → read → update → delete
- Use `run_claude_logged` + `show_tools_used` for diagnostics
- Clean up after yourself (delete test resources)

**Skill triggering tests** (`tests/skill-triggering/prompts/<service>-<action>.txt`):
- One natural-language prompt per file
- Run with: `PLUGIN_DIR=plugins/<plugin> bash tests/skill-triggering/run-test.sh <skill-name> tests/skill-triggering/prompts/<file>.txt`

**Auth helpers** — add a `check_<tool>_auth()` function to `tests/test-helpers.sh` if your tool has its own auth mechanism.

### 6. Update README.md

Add the new plugin/skill to the Plugins section, Installation commands, and Setup instructions.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (no auth required)
PLUGIN_DIR=plugins/<plugin> bash tests/unit/test-<service>-skill.sh

# Integration tests (requires live auth)
PLUGIN_DIR=plugins/<plugin> bash tests/integration/test-<service>-integration.sh

# Skill triggering
PLUGIN_DIR=plugins/<plugin> bash tests/skill-triggering/run-test.sh <skill> tests/skill-triggering/prompts/<prompt>.txt
```

## Design Decisions

- **No wrapper scripts when the CLI is good enough.** The `atlassian` plugin uses wrapper scripts because it needs to abstract auth, ADF construction, and multi-tool fallback. The `google-workspace` plugin invokes `gws` directly because it already handles all of that.
- **One skill per service, one plugin per product family.** Gmail and Calendar are both under `google-workspace`. Jira and Confluence are both under `atlassian`.
- **Skills are self-contained.** Each SKILL.md should contain everything Claude needs to use the service without reading other files (except reference docs it explicitly links to).
- **Tests run Claude in a subprocess.** Unit tests use `run_claude` with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Integration tests use `run_claude_logged` with `--output-format stream-json` to capture tool usage.
